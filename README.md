Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. In order to identify which individuals are at the highest risk, a machine learning application is developed to identify the best predictors of disease to inform physician practice. This application aims to address the following:
- What are the most accurate predictors of cardiovascular disease?
- What locations in the United States are associated with higher relative quantities of the leading predictors?

## Data Source
The data was sourced from a Cardiovascular Dataset found in Kaggle. The dataset consists of 70,000 patient records collected during medical examinations and contains 11 features.  

Features:

- Age (days)
- Height (cm) 
- Weight (kg) 
- Gender (1-male; 2-female)
- Systolic blood pressure 
- Diastolic blood pressure 
- Cholesterol (1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal)
- Glucose (1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal)
- Smoking
- Alcohol intake 
- Physical activity 
- Presence or absence of cardiovascular disease (target variable)
